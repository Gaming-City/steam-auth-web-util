[*Steam Auth Web Util*](http://scholtzm.github.io/steam-auth-web-util/) is a tiny browser utility to generate Steam auth codes from the given `shared_secret` and `identity_secret`. Entire app runs directly in the web browser and does *not* do any external calls.

Can be used in case you are debugging your project or when you have your keys but they are not associated with the mobile app.
